## 🌍 Deployment

Some of the projects can be easily deployed on cloud platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Azure**. The following steps outline a generic approach for deploying a Flask-based web app on Heroku:

1. **Install Heroku CLI**:  
   Follow the instructions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. **Login to Heroku**:  
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. **Create a new Heroku app**:  
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

4. **Push to Heroku**:  
   Ensure your `Procfile` is correctly set up for Flask:
   ```plaintext
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```
   Then push the project to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

5. **View your deployed app**:  
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

You can follow similar steps for AWS (using **Elastic Beanstalk**) or Azure (using **App Services**).

## 🎯 Roadmap

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Integrate **Explainable AI (XAI)** models for better understanding of predictions in complex models.
- [ ] Add **Docker** support for easy containerization of all projects.
- [ ] Incorporate **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Migrate some projects to use **streamlit** for interactive dashboards.
- [ ] Explore **Reinforcement Learning** for game-based AI projects.
- [ ] Expand the **NLP** section to include text summarization, translation, and more chatbot capabilities.
